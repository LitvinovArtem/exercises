Exercises for the Lecture 1 of the Haskell Beginners course.

To complete exercises, you need to complete implementation and add
missing top-level type signatures. You can implement any additional
helper functions. But you can't change the names of the given
functions.

Comments before each function contain explanations and example of
arguments and expected returned values.

It's absolutely okay if you feel that your implementations are not
perfect. You can return to these exercises after future lectures and
improve your solutions if you see any possible improvements.

{- | Specify the type signature of the following function. Think about
its behaviour, possible types for the function arguments and write the
type signature explicitly.
-}
makeSnippet :: Int -> String -> String
makeSnippet limit text = take limit ("Description: " ++ text) ++ "..."

{- | Implement a function that takes two numbers and finds sum of
their squares.

>>> sumOfSquares 3 4
25

>>> sumOfSquares (-2) 7
53

Explanation: @sumOfSquares 3 4@ should be equal to @9 + 16@ and this
is 25.
-}
-- DON'T FORGET TO SPECIFY THE TYPE IN HERE
sumOfSquares :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
sumOfSquares x y = (x * x) + (y * y)

{- | Implement a function that returns the last digit of a given number.

>>> lastDigit 42
2
>>> lastDigit (-17)
7

ðŸ•¯ HINT: use the @mod@ function

-}
-- DON'T FORGET TO SPECIFY THE TYPE IN HERE
lastDigit :: Integer -> Integer
lastDigit n = if ((abs n) < 10) then abs n else lastDigit (mod (abs n) 10)

{- | Write a function that takes three numbers and returns the
difference between the biggest number and the smallest one.

>>> minmax 7 1 4
6

Explanation: @minmax 7 1 4@ returns 6 because 7 is the biggest number
and 1 is the smallest, and 7 - 1 = 6.

Try to use local variables (either let-in or where) to implement this
function.
-}
minmax :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer -> Integer
minmax x y z = maxNumber - minNumber
  where
    maxNumber = max (max x y) z
    minNumber = min (min x y) z 

{- | Implement a function that takes a string, start and end positions
and returns a substring of a given string from the start position to
the end (including).

>>> subString 3 7 "Hello, world!"
"lo, w"

>>> subString 10 5 "Some very long String"
""

This function can accept negative start and end position. Negative
start position can be considered as zero (e.g. substring from the
first character) and negative end position should result in an empty
string.
-}
subString :: Int -> Int -> String -> String
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
subString start end str = take length cropedString 
  where
    length = (end - start) + 1
=======
subString start end str = take diff cropedString 
  where
    diff = endPosition - startPosition
    startPosition = if (start >= 0) then start else 0
    endPosition = if (end >= 0) then end+1 else 0
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
    cropedString = drop start str

{- | Write a function that takes a String â€” space separated numbers,
and finds a sum of the numbers inside this string.

>>> strSum "100    -42  15"
73

The string contains only spaces and/or numbers.
-}
strSum :: String -> Integer
strSum str = sum nums
  where
    wordsList = words str
    nums = map closure wordsList
    closure = (read::String -> Integer)

{- | Write a function that takes a number and a list of numbers and
returns a string, saying how many elements of the list are strictly
greated than the given number and strictly lower.

>>> lowerAndGreater 3 [1 .. 9]
"3 is greater than 2 elements and lower than 6 elements"

Explanation: the list [1 .. 9] contains 9 elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
The given number 3 is greater than 2 elements (1 and 2)
and lower than 6 elements (4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9).

ðŸ•¯ HINT: Use recursion to implement this function.
-}
lowerAndGreater :: Integer -> [Integer] -> String
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
lowerAndGreater n list = show n ++ " is greater than " ++ show lesserCount ++ " and lower than " ++ show biggerCount ++ " elements"
=======
lowerAndGreater n list = show n ++ " is greater than " ++ show lesserCount ++ " elements and lower than " ++ show biggerCount ++ " elements"
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
  where
    lesserCount = length lesserNumbers
    biggerCount = length biggerNumbers
    lesserNumbers = filter (<n) list
    biggerNumbers = filter (>n) list
